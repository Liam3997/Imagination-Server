# Imagination-Server
A C# server for LEGO Universe, that will (hopefully not?) die.  

*The LEGO Group has not endorsed or authorized the operation of this game and is not liable for any safety issues in relation to the operation of this game*

## Project Info
Imagination Server is an Lego Universe server emulator started by MicleBrick and currently being built-upon and maintained by Liam3997. 

Current goals for the project are:
* Build a fully functioning Lego Universe server emulator
* Build an emulator that can be used by anybody to host their own personal LU servers
* Build a GUI and guide for the emulator that will enable users with little technical know-how to run their own personal LU servers
* Remain completely, 100% open-source, for anybody to contribute to. If you want to contribute, [you can get started here](https://github.com/Liam3997/Imagination-Server/wiki/Contribution-Guide)!
* Bring together anyone who loves LU and wants to help it come back to life
* Introduce some new faces to the LU development community and the LU community in general!

## More Info
Unlike (most) other LEGO Universe servers, this uses C#, a managed, Object-Oriented programming language. It is run as a single application, and uses SQLite with Fluent NHibernate for storing data.

## Modules
### Base
ImaginationServer.Core - C++ code that provides a wrapper around RakNet  
ImaginationServer.Common - Base C# server code shared between servers
### Enums
ImaginationServer.Enums - Enums that are used throughout the project
### Launchers
ImaginationServer.CLILaunch - Application that runs the Auth and World servers  
ImaginationServer.ControlPanel - Same as single server, but with a GUI (not implemented)
### Servers
ImaginationServer.Auth - Authentication server, commands, packets  
ImaginationServer.SQL_DB - Manages all the SQLite and NHibernate stuff needed for the server  
ImaginationServer.World - World server and packets
### Utilities
None yet...
